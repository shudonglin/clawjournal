"""Drive the cost ledger from already-ingested `events` rows.

Walks new `events` rows since the cost ledger's last successful run,
runs the per-client extractor against `raw_json`, and persists a row
(`data_source='api'`) when the vendor surfaced usage. Rows that carry
no usage block are still marked as examined via the cost-ingest cursor
so repeated runs do not rescan them forever.

For Codex — where the model id is carried on `turn_context` rather
than the `token_count` event itself — we backfill the most-recently-
seen model per session as we walk in canonical order, and seed from
earlier raw events when a token_count lands in a later batch than its
preceding turn_context.

This module deliberately does NOT perform content-length estimation.
The spec leaves the door open for `data_source='estimated'` rows but
the v0.1 ingest only records what the API actually emitted; the
extraction layer (`clawjournal/events/cost/extract/`) returns None
for lines without a usage block. Estimation is tracked as a
follow-up so that the data we do persist is unambiguously vendor
truth.

After token_usage rows land for the touched sessions, we run the
anomaly detectors on those sessions and replace that session's
`cost_anomalies` rows with the fresh hit set so stale anomalies do not
linger after late-arriving events change adjacency or baselines.
