"""Scan-time findings pipeline driver.

Wraps the deterministic-engine scan + transactional DB rebuild in one
entry point (`run_findings_pipeline`) that the Scanner, one-shot CLI
`scan`, and `scan --force` all reach. Also hosts the bounded backfill
drain for sessions flagged at schema-migration time.

Design notes, mirroring docs/security-refactor.md §Scan flow:

- **Settle threshold.** Active sessions (missing or too-recent
  `end_time`) are skipped for this tick — they would otherwise churn
  `findings_revision` on every scan as new messages arrive.
- **Revision short-circuit.** `compute_findings_revision(session,
  config=...)` runs first; a match against `sessions.findings_revision`
  means nothing has changed and the rebuild is skipped.
- **Transactional rebuild.** The actual delete + insert + revision
  update runs inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so concurrent CLI decisions and
  Scanner rebuilds serialize cleanly on the write lock.
- **Zero-findings revisions still persist.** A settled session that
  scans clean writes its revision anyway so the next tick short-
  circuits; otherwise a clean session would re-scan every pass.
- **Force mode.** `force=True` bypasses both the settle and revision
  checks — used by `scan --force` and its API mirror.
